# Live traffic detection

The classes for each task is clearly labelled and in their own files. Common configuration options can be found and set in ParameterTuner.py

ou will need to download a YOLO model to make use of this project. Unless you are using YOLOv11s, you will need to edit your path to the model manually in VehicleDetector.py
The default path is "models/yolo11s.pt"

# TODO
